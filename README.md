# General Notes

Making a neural network setup that can play [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) well (or at least as well as a semi-skilled human).

## Goals
+ (^ above)

## Tweaking Parameters:

+ Generations
+ Nets
+ Games
+ Hidden Size
+ Survivor Choice Method
+ Mutation Rate (random boolean to determine whether or not to mutate)
+ Mutation Method (different distributions, different std dev's)
+ Random insertion of newcomers (yes/no, possibly how many/how often)
+ Cross-mutation (two parents instead of the current one)
+ Depth of game tree


## Other

Sentence to understand:
"Backpropagation, an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent."
